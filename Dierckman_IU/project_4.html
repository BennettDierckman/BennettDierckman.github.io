				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p> TeleWorking describes an arrangement made between employees and employers, where employees are not required to travel to a central location to work. Under this arrangement employees can exercise their freedom to work in environment(s) that suits them best.  This policy is will describe the GOAL organizations guidelines for their teleWork program that must be followed to achieve optimal effectiveness, and effectively promote the organizations missiona. The new policy is to be emailed to every volunteer and employee and is to be digitaly signed so that it is ensured everywone helping with GOAL's organization acknowlages the new policy. When an employee fails to comply with IT policy will result in termination. Volunteers who fail to comply will be unable to contribute to GOALS organization untill compliance is obtained.</p>

					<tr>
						<th></th>
						<th>Department of Defense</th>
						<th>CommuterChallange.org</th>
						<th>Analysis</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Policy Purpose</th>
						<td>Employees who telework must be available to work at the traditional worksite on telework days on an occasional basis if necessitated by work requirements</td>
						<td>Teleworking is not a formal, universal employee benefit. Rather, it is an alternative method of meeting the needs of the company.</td>
						<td>Department of Defense describes telework as an added benefit, the worker may still have to commute to actuall worksite. CommuterChallange policy describes telework as a complete alternative to the traditional workplace.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Scope</th>
						<td>Agreement prescribes the approved alternative worksite and telework schedule, and addresses personnel, security, and equipment issues.</td>
						<td>TeleWork applies to anyone who wishes to work from the home, without commuting to and from a workplace, and describes their duties and responsibilities.</td>
						<td>Both scopes describe aproved alterntive workspaces, and describe criteria of a teleWork employee.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>The Actual Policy Statement(s)</th>
						<td><p>Time spent in a telework status must be accounted for and reported in the same manner as if the employee reported for duty at the traditional worksite.</p>
							<p>An employee must have a proven, or expected (for new employees), performance rating of "fully successful" or equivalent, to be eligible for participation.</p>
							<p>The existing rules on hours of duty apply to teleworking employees(including overtime policy).</p>
							<p>The official duty station corresponds to that found on the most recent SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action.</p> 
							<p>If a situation arises at the employee's alternative worksite that results in the employee being unable to continue working (e.g., power failure), the supervisor should determine action on a case-by-case basis.</p>
							<p>Telework is excellent for accommodating employees with disabilities.</p>
							<p>Teleworkers are responsible for the security of all official data, protection of any Government-furnished equipment and property, and accomplishment of the mission of DoD at the alternative worksite</p>
							<p>No classified documents (hard copy or electronic) may be taken to an employee's alternative worksite.</p>
							<p>Employees who are directly engaged in performing the duties of their jobs are covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), regardless of whether the work is performed on the agency's premises or at an alternative worksite.</p></td>
						<td><p>The employee's compensation, benefits, work status and work responsibilities will not change due to participation in the teleworking program</p>
							<p>Upon acceptance to the program both the employee and manager will be expected to complete a training course designed to prepare them for the teleworking experience.  All teleworkers must sign an agreement.</p>
							<p>The use of equipment, software, data supplies and furniture when provided by the company for use at the remote work location is limited to authorized persons and for purposes relating to company business.  The company will provide for repairs to company equipment.  When the employee uses her/his own equipment, the employee is responsible for maintenance and repair of equipment.</p>
							<p>The employee shall designate a workspace within the remote work location for placement and installation of equipment to be used while teleworking.  The employee shall maintain this workspace in a safe condition, free from hazards and other dangers to the employee and equipment.  The company must approve the site chosen as the employee's remote workspace.</p>
							<p>The company has the right to make on-site visits (with 48 hours advance notice) to the remote work location for purposes of determining that the site is safe and free from hazards, and to maintain, repair, inspect, or retrieve company-owned equipment, software, data or supplies.</p>
							<p>Office supplies will be provided by the company as needed.  Out-of-pocket expenses for other supplies will not be reimbursed unless by prior approval of the employee's manager.</p>
							<p>During work hours and while performing work functions in the designated work area of the home, teleworkers are covered by worker's compensation.</p>
							<p>The employee's home workspace will be considered an extension of the company's workspace.  Therefore, the company will continue to be liable for job-related accidents that occur in the employee's home workspace during the employee's working hours.</p>
							<p>Employees must be available by phone and email during core hours.  All client interactions will be conducted on a client or company site.  Participants will still be available for staff meetings, and other meetings deemed necessary by management.</p>
							<p>The employee shall agree to participate in all studies, inquiries, reports and analyses relating to this program.</p></td>
						<td><p>Both policies explain that time spent working at home will be treated exactly the same as time spent working at work.</p>
							<p>Department of Defense requires a specific performance rating inorder to be acceped into teleWork program(training occours before acceptance), where as with the CommuterChallange sample policy, training occours post program acceptance.</p>
							<p>The department of defense requires at home worksites to meet a certian standard(SF 50, Notification of Personal Action), Were as CommuterChallange.orgs policy simply states that the employee, "shall designate a workspace within the remote work location for placement and instalation of equipment to be used."</p><p> CommuterChallanges looser workstation requrements are subsidized by potential on-site-visits, which are not called for in Department of Defenses policy.</p>
							<p>Unlike the CommuterChallange.org data policy, the Department of Defense includes a significant amount of policy reguarding data/information security.</p>
							<p>Both Policies consider the at-home-workstation to be an extension of the workplace.</p>
							<p>Both policies explain liability for incidances that occour at the at home workstataion.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Rational</th>
						<td><p>Savings in time and reduced stress by avoiding the commute to the traditional worksite, resulting in more and higher quality time with family, and a healthier lifestyle.</p>
						<p>Savings in commuting costs.</p>
						<p>Convience</p>
						<p>Enabling work at peak productivity times</p></td>
						<td>TeleWork provides an alternative method of meeting the needs of the company.</td>
						<td>The difference in rational suguests that the two organizations view teleWork differently.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Method of enforcement</th>
						<td>TeleWork Agreement Form</td>
						<td>None Stated</td>
						<td>The Department of Defense uses an Agreement Form because it serves as an effective way to ensure that everyone involved is aware, and will comply with teleWork policy.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Intended Outcomes</th>
						<td>The intended outcome is that the employee acknowledges that he/she continues to be bound by the Department of Defense standards of conduct while working at the alternative worksite and using Government-furnished equipment.</td>
						<td>The intended outcome is that the employee shall agree to participate in all studies, inquiries, reports and analyses relating to this program.</td>
						<td>Both intended outcomes encompass the idea that the employee fully undertsands the standards of the at-home-workplace and what is expected.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Consequences of Violation</th>
						<td>This telework agreement can be terminated by either the employee or the supervisor by advance written notice. Management shall terminate the telework agreement should the employee's performance not meet the prescribed standard, or the teleworking arrangement fails to meet organizational needs.</td>
						<td>The company has the right to refuse to make teleworking available to an employee and to terminate a teleworking arrangement at any time</td>
						<td>CommuterChallange.org explains that they have the right to terminate the agreement at any time, where the Department of Defense explains that they will terminate the agreement with written notice, upon discovery of poor performance.</td>
