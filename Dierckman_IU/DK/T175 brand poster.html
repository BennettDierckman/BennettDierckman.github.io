    	<p>
        Competing as a national level Olympic lifter taught me a few valuable life lessons. The attention to detail, immense amount of effort, and dedication applied for years on end has taught me what it takes to achieve true success, and the value of doing things the right way. I've carried these lessons over into my life here in Bloomington as a student, a weightlifting coach, an employee at the chemistry library, and as the Doorstaff Manager at Kilroys at the Dunkirk.

        <br>
       
		<p>The unique experiences listed above are what make me a valuable asset. Few people work more than 40 hours a week on top of a full university course load, nor do many college students manage 20 doorstaff and coordinate with general managers and performers to put on shows nearly every week. Here at Indiana University I've learned and continue to learn a plethora of technical skills that are important in industry, but more importantly i have intrinsic values and soft skills that allow me to bring people together to accomplish a common goal. This is what excites me most about entering the industry in the coming years. </p>
