    <h2> <u> Homepage Introduction </u> </h2>
  <p> This website is a website that was created in order to display the various skills that I learned throughout the semester in I-101. The skills included are computer coding skills, as well as any other skills valuable in the work place. </p>
  <h2> <u> Self Introduction </u> </h2>
  <p>I am an aspiring Informaticist at Indiana University. I also have a strong interest in international business, spanish, and portuguese. Here in Bloomington I work part time for the IU chemistry library working the circulation desk, and I also work nights as the doorstaff manager at Kilroy's at the Dunnkirk. During the little free-time I have I enjoy driving and working on cars, my favorite car is a 1989 corvett my father owns. I also workout to stay in shape as well as coach olympic weightlifting at Force Fitness.</p>
