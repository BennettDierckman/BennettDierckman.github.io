<h1>Week 6 Lab 1</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>"Do you think programing is important? Why?"</h3>
<p>I Know that programing is important. It is important because with out programing, we would not be able to get computers to do what we want them to do.</p>
<h3>"How do you think differently when you code compared to other tasks?"</h3>
<p>When I code, I think of coding different from other tasks, such as using dream weaver. When I code, I think of python as an entity I communicate with to get it to communicate what I want it to communicate.</p>
<h3>"List a question you have about programing."</h3>
<p>How do we get from typing commands to having a developed program, and are there different genres of programs?</p>

<br/>
<li>Interactions Area: You can write code here aswell, but it will not be saved to disc. You can call functions here that are defined in the program area.</li>
<br/>
<li>File Menu: Allows you to manage code files.</li>
<br/>
<li>Edit Menu: Basic edditing comands, just like you would see in any application.</li>
<br/>
<li>Watcher Menu: Allows you to watch the value of variables during program execution. Helps with debbugging.</li>
<br/>
<li>Media Tools Menu: Contains tools that help us examine aspects of the different media.</li>
<br/>
