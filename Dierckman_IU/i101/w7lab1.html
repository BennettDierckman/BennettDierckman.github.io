<h1>Week 7 Lab 1</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>What is a function? How do we create one?</h3>
<p>A function is something entered into JES that gives instruction to the program. We create functions by defining them in the program area using "def".</p>
<h3>Why are functions so usefull?</h3>
<p>Functions are usefull in programing because they simplify things and save the user the trouble of having to type things again and again.</p>
<h3>In your own words, describe what a loop is.</h3>
<p>In my own words, I feel like a loop is something that can be created with the intention of the loop being applied to the program "as a whole"
<h3>How do loops help us in programing? Give an example of when you would use a loop.</h3>
<p>Loops help us by saving us time as well. For example if you want to toy with the color of the picture as a whole, you can use a loop to save the time of changing the pixels one at a time.</p>
