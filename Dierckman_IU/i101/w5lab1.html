<hr/>
<h3>"What did you know about programing before this class?"</h3>
<p> Before this class, I knew very little about programing.</p>
<h3>"How do you like programing?"</h3>
<p>Although I find it confusing, I see the point, and find it interesting.</p>
<h3>"How comfortable do you feel with programing?"</h3>
<p> I need to work with it more before I am comfortable with it. I am learning so much, so fast in I101.
