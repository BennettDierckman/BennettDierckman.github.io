<div class="intro">In todays world, technology has found its way into every aspect of human life in one way or another. When we talk about informatics, it helps to break it down into more specific, "genres", and so we have cognates of informatics. This Mini project will talk about the different cognates I will be exploring thruought my time here at IU. </div>

<div class="cognate1"><h3>Cognate 1</h3>
  <p>	 As a rather new cognate, music adresses the technologies that are used in the modern music realm. The cognate deals with the technology used for production, distribution, and consumpsion of musical media. In music informatics, we study the digital revolution in music, and discuss current trends in hardware and software used. And more importantly, we talk about the future of technologies role in music libraries, production, and distribution.</p>
  <p>In the real world we don't see the informatics music cognate at work, nearly as much as we &quot;hear&quot; it at work. Everytime you turn on the radio, browse your spotify, or hear someone playing an electric instrument, you are hearing music informatics at work. I am choosing this specialty area because of my love for music and technology. </p>
</div>
<div class="cognate2"><h3>Cognate 2</h3>
<p> The other cognate that I will be studying is communication and culture. This cognate focuses on the way in which information is transferd and communicated. Focusing more specifically how technology has transformed culture and the way we communicate.</p> 
<p>A person with a this cognate can work to design webpages, further social media development, work with technical writing or content development and much more. I am choosing this as a cognate because of my intrest in social media, and the way people communicate with eachother.</p></div>
