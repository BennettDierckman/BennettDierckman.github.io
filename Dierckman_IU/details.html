					<td>Perhaps, It stems from someone asking someone, "Who's there."</td>
					<td>When a visitor hailed a pioneer cabin in Indiana or knocked upon its door, the settler would respond, "Who's yere?" And from this frequent response Indiana became the "Who's yere" or Hoosier state. No one ever explained why this was more typical of Indiana than of Illinois or Ohio.</td>						
					<td><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html">Wells Library</a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Belief that the term hoosier emplies a hard working trust worthy person.</td>
					<td>There was once a contractor named Hoosier employed on the Louisville and Portland Canal who preferred to hire laborers from Indiana. They were called "Hoosier's men" and eventually all Indianans were called Hoosiers.</td>
					<td><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html">Wells Library</a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Someone picking up an ear off the ground and inquiring about who's it is.</td>
					<td>Quite as possible is a facetious explanation offered by "The Hoosier Poet," James Whitcomb Riley. He claimed that Hoosier originated in the pugnacious habits of our early settlers. They were enthusiastic and vicious fighters who gouged, scratched and bit off noses and ears. This was so common an occurrence that a settler coming into a tavern the morning after a fight and seeing an ear on the floor would touch it with his toe and casually ask, "Whose ear?"</td>
					<td><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html">Wells Library</a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Possibly related to the states strong agricultural ties.</td>
					<td>It is also possible that it comes from the word Hoosa, which means American Indian maize or corn.</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Another version of play on words.</td>
					<td>"Who's your [relative]?"- Again, legend has it that this question was eventually shortened to "Hoosier?"</td>

			<p>With all the possibilities, it is hard to deduce which is truly the source of the word "Hoosier". After hours of research and deduction, the Mystery Team and I believe we have produced a somewhat broad definition do describe the word hoosier. We define it as a coincidental mispronunciation that happened at somepoint at somplace in Indiana.</p>
